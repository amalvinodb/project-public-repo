# the reade me file for the public repo for my first ecommerce website 
this website was made on the men stack with hbs as a template engine 
this repo contains my path to learn the nodejs and mongodb 

there are several things that i found through this journey 
1. hbs has the most pritiest syntax among all the view engins that i have seen and tried 
2. but also the most horible developer experience when it comes to the condetional statements mainly if which is a total nightmare
   this is due to the fact that hbs if condetion can only do either true or false values and no condetional operators
   we have to litterely feed it the true or false values and if there is any data of any sort it will default to true 
   it was a nightmare to do a simple button hidding in this process. dont use hbs if u are doing a ecommerce websit user ejs which is much more developer friendly
